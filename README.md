# Antlr Play
This is a playground for learning how to use Antlr4 inside a Typescript project.

## How to use
Generate the lexer and parser using the Antlr4 CLI:
```bash
yarn generate
```

Use the generated modules to parse a file:
```bash
yarn start
```

Note that the Deno usage is currently broken, you still want to use NodeJS for now.
